The Provider and Location Registry (PLR) is a standards-based repository of core provider data supplied by authorized sources and available to authorized consumers that facilitates the formal exchange of health information. PLR also contains delivery site information for Community Care and Mental Health facilities. PLR is one of the fundamental building blocks toward realization of the pan-Canadian Electronic Health Record (EHR).

PLR supports BC Health stakeholder needs for a comprehensive, trusted and reliable custodian and source of core health provider, location and facility information. As a central source for provider and location information, PLR assists BC Health organizations to achieve effort and cost efficiencies. Definition and development of comprehensive core and augmented data sets ensures all required provider and location data elements are available for stakeholder business use and consistent business processes and technology standards ensures stakeholdersâ€™ resources are maximized
